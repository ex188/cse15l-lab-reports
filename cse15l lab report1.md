Type in the following command

```
$ ssh cs15lsp23--@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

The -- part should be the characters that you have on your account that's different with the command above. 
You don't have to type in $. Just a way to write command. 

Then it shoud go to this message:
```

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.     
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

Type: yes and press enter. 
It will ask for your password, type it in and press enter.

You can try the following:
* ```cd ~```
* ```cd```
* ```ls -lat```
* ```ls -a```
* ```ls <directory> ```
 put <directory> as ```/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc``` where abc is another group members' username. 
* ```cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/```
* ```cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt```
